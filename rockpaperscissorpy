# This code is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
import random

options = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
while True:
    user = input("Input Rock/Paper/Scissors = ").upper()
    if user != options:
        print("invalid input")
        break
    computer = random.choice(options)
    print("Computer", computer)

    if user == computer:
        print("Draw")
    elif (
        (user == "Rock" and computer == "Scissors")
        or (user == "Paper" and computer == "Rock")
        or (user == "Scissors" and computer == "Paper")
    ):
        print("You won the game bro")

    else:
        print("You loose")

    play = input("Want to play again ? (Y/N)").upper()
    if play != "Y":
        print("Thanks for playing ")
        break
